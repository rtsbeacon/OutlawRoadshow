      "bio":"Fort Frances' new album is, No One Needs to Know Our Name. Yes, it's an odd title for an record considering most independent bands are doing everything possible to win exposure. It’s more of a personal manifesto of this band. In an age of hyper-connectivity and public oversharing, frontman and chief lyricist, David McMillin, says, “This is a reminder that we are all allowed to shut out the noise.” Fort Frances is McMillin, Aaron Kiser and Jeffrey Piper."
