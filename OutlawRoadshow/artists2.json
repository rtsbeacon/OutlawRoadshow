      "bio":"Fort Frances' new album is, No One Needs to Know Our Name. Yes, it's an odd title for an record considering most independent bands are doing everything possible to win exposure. It’s more of a personal manifesto of this band. In an age of hyper-connectivity and public oversharing, frontman and chief lyricist, David McMillin, says, “This is a reminder that we are all allowed to shut out the noise.” Fort Frances is McMillin, Aaron Kiser and Jeffrey Piper."

While the members have changed and the band has grown in numbers (they currently bring 8-9 people to the stage) the band is still developing it’s soul/rock sound. With two guitars, bass, drums, organ/keys, three female background singers, and a front man from yesterday, OldJack belts out their original material with lots of harmonies, big vocals, and guitar solos galore."

He prefers bygone rock sounds, leading his band on resonator, mouth harp, banjo, guitar, Hammond B3 and Piano, the latter being his primary tool. “The piano playing came out of necessity. I wanted to write country ballads, Motown grooves and gospel music and it’s not the same on the guitar,” he says, drawing from southern soul and rock as well — his heroes garnered from classic rock radio’s key kings like Leon Russell, Billy Preston and Gregg Allman."

He has proven himself as a top-notch songwriter.  Cory Branan is a natural-born storyteller, his seemingly conversational, painstakingly crafted anecdotes benefitting from a hard-eyed stare at hydra-headed life experiences. Not unlike his musical and literary pedestal sitters, from John Prine and Leonard Cohen to Raymond Carver and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Cory's gift for detail and phrase-turning is a thing of wonder. Cory has a well-documented history with groups like former label mates Lucero, musicians of his ilk who trend toward the rawer end of roots music (The Loved Ones' Dave Hause, Chuck Ragan, The Hold Steady, The Gaslight Anthem, Two Cow Garage, Drag the River's Jon Snodgrass), and rock stars like Chris Carrabba (Dashboard Confessional), who has covered Cory's gorgeous \"Tall Green Grass\" and been a reoccurring tour mate. Never one to shy away from an itinerary of non-stop cross-country shows, Cory possesses a unique performance style that enables him to gravelly sing a coy double entendre in one ear of the audience, while yelling the most beautiful love song into the other."

The band are set to release their debut album 'Geode' early next year on Mom+Pop.  ELEL, consisting of two horns, two drums, three keys ,guitar, bass and whole lot of vocals, was born from front man Ben Elkins meeting a girl named Eliska. Ben's now wife softened his edges while introducing him to the likes of Beach House and Toro Y Moi. Speaking on ELEL, Ben says 'It’s the outcome of me producing music that risks leaving space and communicates emotion easily and softly.'  This band represents a new start for its members, for a variety of reasons. Tied together by the bustling Nashville music scene but from an array of locations, ELEL includes Ben (Arkansas), Zach (Kentucky), Tim (Mississippi), Jo Jo (Queens, NY), Alex (Pennsylvania), and life-long Nashvillians (so far) Fredrick, Jerry and Stefan. According to Ben, '40 Watt is a big loud dance song about dancing with one other person in a little bitty house.' We have more exciting news very soon."
