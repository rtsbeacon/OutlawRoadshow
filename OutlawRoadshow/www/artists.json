      "bio":"On K Phillips' debut American Girls, the West Texan champions the desperate, the sleazy and the broken, with small-town murals that glimpse into the jealousy of a sheriff, lovers that freeze to death and a crude lothario that misquotes dead poets. He prefers bygone rock sounds, leading his band on resonator, mouth harp, banjo, guitar, Hammond B3 and Piano, the latter being his primary tool. “The piano playing came out of necessity. I wanted to write country ballads, Motown grooves and gospel music and it’s not the same on the guitar,” he says, drawing from southern soul and rock as well — his heroes garnered from classic rock radio’s key kings like Leon Russell, Billy Preston and Gregg Allman."

Upon writing over fifty songs together, they decided to take things to the next level and form a band. After a self-released demo, they were signed to Alive Natural Sound, releasing their debut Ride On The Train in March 2013. Critical acclaim soon followed as Rolling Stone, Spin, and American Songwriter all premiered material from the album. On April 19, 2014, they released an exclusive Record Store Day tribute to The Velvet Underground."
