      "bio":"Cheyenne Medders has been writing and recording songs for more than half his life. Born in Northern Georgia into a musical family, he absorbed the songs coming out of his father’s mouth and from their stereo. It’s no wonder that Cheyenne’s aspiration became creating music as timeless as it is progressive. He has been described as \"Warren Zevon meets The Shins\".  AN INTRODUCTION - Now a family man with a new album in tow, Cheyenne's history in Nashville goes back to the summer of 2006, when he first moved to the city and released his first album Carry Us Away, a prog-folk work that Maverick Magazine described as \"very different, very good\" and \"a cut above the rest.\" Matching the rambling, acoustic vibe of the record, he assembled a folk band and hit the road for a Pacific Coast tour in a minivan, selling cds and t-shirts and staying with friends along the way. It's been a life in music and stories ever since."

      "bio":"When I heard Jill Andrews' music, a combination of traditional styles rolled into pop, I knew immediately how talented she is. A wonderful storyteller, her voice is - pretty much perfect. And others think so too. In the last few years her work has reached international audiences via soldout live shows and an infusion of her music in popular television programs. Chances are, you've heard Jill Andrews' music and never even knew it. A pioneer in the area, now everyone's crossing Americana and Country into popular music - this is one of the people who helped bring it to you first. A native of East Tennessee, Jill Andrews kicked off her songwriting career as co-founder of the Everybodyfields, a band whose mix of Southern genres — folk, country, bluegrass — and male-female vocals helped pave the way for future groups like the Civil Wars. After three albums, Andrews left that band and launched a solo career, starting with a self-titled EP and a full-length record, The Mirror, that built something bigger and broader on top of her Americana roots. On her upcoming solo record, The War Inside, Jill Andrews shines a light on her own struggles and successes, tying the songs together with a new sound that mixes her folk background with a wider set of influences. While working on The War Inside, Jill signed a publishing deal and began landing songs in multiple TV shows and movies, including Grey's Anatomy, Nashville, American Idol, Hart of Dixie, and Me, Him, Her (2015) etc.... One of her songs, 'Joy Parade,' also appeared in The Music of Nashville: Season 2, Volume 2, a TV soundtrack that rose to number 13 on the Billboard 200. But Andrews made sure to save the best songs for her own record."

A considerable maturation from their 2013 release 'Home Videos', Buffalo Rodeo strives to combine tight rhythms and ambient melodies with expressive vocal harmonies on their newest release.  Formed around 2008 in a music-thirsty gulch of the hills of Bowling Green, KY around the likes of Cage the Elephant, Sleeper/Agent, and Morning Teleportation, Buffalo Rodeo has worked tirelessly as an independent band securing shows at festivals such as The Big To-Do Festival, Starry Nights Music & Arts Festival, and Riot Fest, as well as booking tours in around 25 states in 2013 alone."

He prefers bygone rock sounds, leading his band on resonator, mouth harp, banjo, guitar, Hammond B3 and Piano, the latter being his primary tool. \"The piano playing came out of necessity. I wanted to write country ballads, Motown grooves and gospel music and it’s not the same on the guitar,\" he says, drawing from southern soul and rock as well — his heroes garnered from classic rock radio’s key kings like Leon Russell, Billy Preston and Gregg Allman."

June 2013 saw the release of a second EP \"Lowlife Dreams\" which was Mastered by Grammy Award Winner Brian Lucey (best known for his work on The Black Keys' \"Brothers\" and \"El Camino\")."

Finally coming to terms with the songs in his heart, Leavitt has crafted an utterly amazing debut album in, You, Me and The Silence. It's a near-masterpiece of emotive storytelling and gentile grace. The more I have listened to the songs off this record, the more I have fallen for them - and you will too. These songs are mesmerizing. Nate Leavitt needs no more than 4 minutes to break your heart. Nate Leavitt is definitely one to watch!"
